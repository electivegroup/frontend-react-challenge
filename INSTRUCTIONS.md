# Instructions

To get the project up and running locally you will need to do the following:

1. Clone my repo: https://github.com/bernardbaker/electivegroup-react-trello.git

2. Update the `react-trello` package source with your new repo URL. Mine is the URL in step one. Remember to keep the `${GITHUB_USER}` and `${GITHUB_TOKEN}` in the string. **They are swapped out at compile time**.

3. Replace the dummy values in preinstall.js with your user name and token (https://github.com/settings/tokens)

4. Run `yarn`.
