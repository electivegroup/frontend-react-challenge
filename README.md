## Create a basic single page app that mimics the behaviour of the Trello board.

**As a** User

**So that** I can manage my task list

Acceptance Criteria:

* There should be 3 columns: “To Do”, “In Progress” and “Done”
* Each card should have name and the description.
* Each card should have due by date which I can specify.
* I should be able to move the cards between columns in both directions.
